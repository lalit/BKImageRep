h1. BKImageRep

h2. About

BKImageRep (and its subclasses) is an image representation for UIImage. It lets you manipulate image data without directly accessing to the Core Graphics framework. 

h2. Background

Due to a light-weighted nature of Cocoa touch, a number of useful classes found on Cocoa is missing (probably existed but hidden as private API). The lack of image representation classes is one example. I don't want to tackle into cumbersome functions of the Core Graphics when I need to directly manipulate image data!

h2. Goal of the project

This project is intended to create a systematic library that has the same API as NSImageRep and its subclasses on the Cocoa framework.
